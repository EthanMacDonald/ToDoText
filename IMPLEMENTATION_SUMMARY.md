# Recurring Task Status Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

### Backend Changes (app.py)

1. **New API Models**:
   - `RecurringTaskStatusRequest`: For handling status updates (completed, missed, deferred)

2. **New Functions**:
   - `log_recurring_task_status()`: Logs task status with timestamp to `recurring_status_log.txt`
   - `get_recurring_tasks_by_filter()`: Filters recurring tasks by time period (today, next7days, all)

3. **New/Updated Endpoints**:
   - `GET /recurring?filter=<filter>`: Get recurring tasks with filtering (today, next7days, all)
   - `POST /recurring/status`: Set status for a recurring task and log it

### Frontend Changes

1. **App.tsx**:
   - Added `recurringFilter` state for filtering recurring tasks
   - Added `handleRecurringStatus()` function for status updates
   - Updated `useEffect` to include filter parameter
   - Added dropdown for recurring task filtering (Today, Next 7 Days, All)

2. **TaskList.tsx**:
   - Added new props: `onRecurringStatus`, `isRecurring`
   - Added status buttons for recurring tasks:
     - ✓ (Completed) - Green button
     - ✗ (Missed) - Red button  
     - ↻ (Deferred) - Orange button
   - Updated TaskItem component to show buttons only for recurring tasks

### Status Tracking

- **Log File**: `/Users/ethan/working_files/NOTES/todo_auto/recurring_status_log.txt`
- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | STATUS | TASK_ID | TASK_DESCRIPTION`
- **Example**:
  ```
  2025-06-26 10:18:09 | COMPLETED | b6b862d03188e60b | review calendar and to-dos
  2025-06-26 10:19:12 | MISSED | 08a6a1fffc1274b0 | review goals
  2025-06-26 10:19:21 | DEFERRED | 16c5d8da6816ed3f | clear emails
  ```

## Testing Results

### Backend Testing
- ✅ `/recurring?filter=today` endpoint works
- ✅ `/recurring/status` endpoint works
- ✅ Status logging creates proper log entries
- ✅ All three status types (completed, missed, deferred) work correctly

### Frontend Testing
- ✅ Dropdown for filtering recurring tasks added
- ✅ Status buttons appear next to recurring tasks
- ✅ Button styling follows the requirements (green, red, orange)

## Usage Instructions

1. **View Recurring Tasks**: Use the dropdown to filter between:
   - Today: Tasks due today
   - Next 7 Days: Tasks due in the next week  
   - All: All recurring tasks

2. **Update Task Status**: Click the appropriate button next to any recurring task:
   - ✓ for completed tasks
   - ✗ for missed tasks
   - ↻ for deferred tasks

3. **Review Performance**: Check the `recurring_status_log.txt` file to review your compliance with recurring tasks over time.

## Implementation Notes

- The filtering logic now properly parses the 'every:' field and filters tasks based on the current date:
  - **Today**: Shows only daily tasks and tasks specifically due today (e.g., weekly:Wed on Wednesday)
  - **Next 7 Days**: Shows daily tasks plus any weekly/monthly/yearly tasks due within the next week
  - **All**: Shows all recurring tasks regardless of schedule
- Custom interval tasks (like semester/bi-annual tasks with `custom:183d`) only appear in the "All" view since they have long intervals
- Status buttons only appear for recurring tasks, not regular tasks.
- The log file grows over time and provides a complete audit trail of recurring task compliance.
- Status updates do not remove tasks from the display - they just log the status for tracking purposes.
