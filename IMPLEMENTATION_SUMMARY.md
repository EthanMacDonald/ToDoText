# Recurring Task Status Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

### Backend Changes (app.py)

1. **New API Models**:
   - `RecurringTaskStatusRequest`: For handling status updates (completed, missed, deferred)

2. **New Functions**:
   - `log_recurring_task_status()`: Logs task status with timestamp to `recurring_status_log.txt`
   - `parse_recurring_status_log()`: Parses log file and returns status data by task ID
   - `get_task_status_for_date()`: Gets the latest status for a task on a specific date
   - `should_show_recurring_task()`: Determines task visibility based on status and recurrence type
   - `get_recurring_tasks_by_filter()`: Filters recurring tasks by time period AND status

3. **New/Updated Endpoints**:
   - `GET /recurring?filter=<filter>`: Get recurring tasks with filtering (today, next7days, all) + status-based hiding
   - `POST /recurring/status`: Set status for a recurring task and log it

### Status-Based Visibility Logic

#### **Completed Tasks**
- **All types**: Hidden until next recurrence date

#### **Missed Tasks**  
- **Daily tasks**: Hidden for current day only
- **Non-daily tasks**: Continue showing (auto-defer until completed)

#### **Deferred Tasks**
- **Daily tasks**: Hidden for current day, will show tomorrow  
- **Non-daily tasks**: Continue showing until completed

### Frontend Changes

1. **App.tsx**:
   - Added `recurringFilter` state for filtering recurring tasks
   - Added `handleRecurringStatus()` function for status updates
   - Updated `useEffect` to include filter parameter
   - Added dropdown for recurring task filtering (Today, Next 7 Days, All)

2. **TaskList.tsx**:
   - Added new props: `onRecurringStatus`, `isRecurring`
   - **Moved status buttons to LEFT side** of recurring tasks:
     - ✓ (Completed) - Green button
     - ✗ (Missed) - Red button  
     - ↻ (Deferred) - Orange button
   - **Removed checkbox/toggle** for recurring tasks
   - Updated TaskItem component to show buttons only for recurring tasks
   - **Fixed dropdown label color** to lighter gray (#666) for better readability

### Status Tracking

- **Log File**: `/Users/ethan/working_files/NOTES/todo_auto/recurring_status_log.txt`
- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | STATUS | TASK_ID | TASK_DESCRIPTION`
- **Example**:
  ```
  2025-06-26 10:18:09 | COMPLETED | b6b862d03188e60b | review calendar and to-dos
  2025-06-26 10:19:12 | MISSED | 08a6a1fffc1274b0 | review goals
  2025-06-26 10:19:21 | DEFERRED | 16c5d8da6816ed3f | clear emails
  ```

## Testing Results

### Backend Testing
- ✅ `/recurring?filter=today` endpoint works with smart filtering
- ✅ `/recurring/status` endpoint works and logs correctly
- ✅ Status logging creates proper log entries
- ✅ All three status types (completed, missed, deferred) work correctly
- ✅ **Status-based hiding implemented and tested**:
  - Completed daily tasks disappear from today view ✓
  - Deferred daily tasks disappear from today view ✓  
  - Missed weekly tasks continue showing (auto-defer) ✓
  - Log file parsing and status determination working ✓

### Frontend Testing
- ✅ Dropdown for filtering recurring tasks added
- ✅ Status buttons moved to left side of tasks
- ✅ Checkbox removed for recurring tasks
- ✅ Button styling follows the requirements (green, red, orange)
- ✅ Dropdown label color fixed for better readability
- ✅ **Dynamic task hiding**: Tasks disappear immediately after status selection

## Usage Instructions

1. **View Recurring Tasks**: Use the dropdown to filter between:
   - **Today**: Tasks due today only (respects current status)
   - **Next 7 Days**: Tasks due in the next week (respects current status)
   - **All**: All recurring tasks (respects current status)

2. **Update Task Status**: Click the appropriate button next to any recurring task:
   - **✓ Completed**: Task will disappear until next recurrence
   - **✗ Missed**: Daily tasks disappear for today; non-daily tasks continue showing (auto-defer)
   - **↻ Deferred**: ALL tasks disappear for today (will reappear on next occurrence)

3. **Review Performance**: Check the `recurring_status_log.txt` file to review your compliance with recurring tasks over time.

4. **Task Behavior**:
   - **Daily tasks**: Reappear every day (unless completed/deferred for that day)
   - **Weekly/Monthly/Yearly**: Only appear on their scheduled days (unless missed and auto-deferred)
   - **Completed tasks**: Hidden until their next scheduled occurrence
   - **Deferred tasks**: Hidden for current day, reappear on next occurrence
   - **Missed non-daily tasks**: Auto-defer and continue showing until completed

## Implementation Notes

- **Dynamic Task Visibility**: Tasks are now intelligently hidden/shown based on their status and recurrence type:
  - **Completed tasks**: Hidden until next recurrence  
  - **Daily missed**: Hidden for current day only
  - **Non-daily missed**: Continue showing (auto-defer behavior)
  - **All deferred tasks**: Hidden for current day (fixed: now applies to weekly/monthly/yearly tasks too)
- **Smart Filtering**: The dropdown now properly parses the 'every:' field and filters tasks based on current date
- **Status Logging**: Complete audit trail maintained in log file for performance review
- **UI Improvements**: Status buttons moved to left, checkbox removed for recurring tasks, better colors
- **Real-time Updates**: Tasks disappear immediately after status selection, providing instant feedback
