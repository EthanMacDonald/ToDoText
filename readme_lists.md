# Lists Feature

The Lists feature provides a simple checklist interface for working through predefined lists like groceries, packing, or any other items you need to check off systematically.

## How It Works

### List Format
Lists use a hierarchical format with area headers and indented checkbox items, similar to the main tasks.txt format:

```
Area Header:
    - [ ] Item description
    - [x] Completed item
    - [ ] Another item with optional metadata

Another Area:
    - [ ] More items
    - [ ] Under this area
```

### Supported Syntax
- Area headers: Lines ending with `:` (not indented)
- `- [ ]` - Unchecked item (must be indented with 4 spaces or tab)
- `- [x]` - Checked/completed item (must be indented)
- `#` - Comments (ignored)
- Empty lines are ignored
